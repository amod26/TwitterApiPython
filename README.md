- Connecting to twitter profile using Twitter API
    -The first step is the registration of your app. In particular, you need to point your browser to http://apps.twitter.com,      log-in to Twitter.You can now choose a name and a description for your app (for example “Mining Demo” or similar). You        will receive a consumer key and a consumer secret: these are application settings that should always be kept private.          From the configuration page of your app, you can also require an access token and an access token secret. Similarly to        the consumer keys, these strings must also be kept private: they provide the application access to Twitter on behalf of       your account. The default permissions are read-only, which is all we need in our case, but if you decide to change your       permission to provide writing features in your app, you must negotiate a new access token.
